# DealFlow AI Documentation

This folder centralizes non-code assets that previously lived in scattered directories.

## Structure
- `product/` — product requirements, scope clarifications, and release planning.
- `ux/` — UX studies, dashboards, and interaction guidelines.
- `architecture/` — versioned solution architecture, data models, and system diagrams.
- `operations/` — runbooks, SOPs, and deployment checklists.

Keep new documentation versioned under the relevant track. Each subdirectory contains its own README that should be updated as the project evolves.
