# DealFlow Frontend

Next.js 14 dashboard that surfaces scoring insights, pipeline workflows, and broker operations.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start the development server.
- `npm run build` — compile production assets.
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint checks.

Shared UI primitives reside in `src/components`. Page-level routes live under `src/pages` until the app directory migration is planned.
